Employee attrition rate, also known as staff turnover or employee churn, is a metric that measures the percentage of employees who leave an organization over a specific period of time. It is a crucial indicator for businesses to assess the stability and health of their workforce. The attrition rate is typically calculated by dividing the number of employees who leave during a given period by the average number of employees during that same period, then multiplying the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.

A high attrition rate can have several implications for an organization. It may indicate dissatisfaction among employees, lack of engagement, or issues with the work environment. High turnover can be costly for businesses due to recruitment and training expenses, as well as potential disruptions in productivity and team dynamics.
